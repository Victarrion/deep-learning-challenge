# deep-learning-challenge
Module 21 Challenge
Module consisted of showing progress done in class regarding deep learning. For this assignment, the task was divided in 4 parts:

Step 1: Preprocess the Data

Step 2: Compile, Train, and Evaluate the Model

Step 3: Optimize the Model

Step 4: Write a Report on the Neural Network Model

Step 5: Copy Files Into Your Repository
Thought  the last step mentions google collab, I opted for a local version of jupyter.
